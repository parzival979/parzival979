#### About Me
Let's cut to the chase. I am a cool guy who believes that anything/any skill in the whole wide world could be learnt, given time and resources. I also like to solve and analyze interesting problems that make me think, but it's really frustrating when you think too much that you don't want to think anymore . I really like the quote "Don't Memorize things You Can Lookup" by Albert Einstein (did he really say that ?, IDK) . I play tennis quite well, I watch lots of Web-Series, like listening to Popular Music and Reading Books And absolutely love football. I really like and can do a lot of things competently that's why i like to think of myself as "Jack of all trades, King of Some"
